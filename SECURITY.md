# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a proof-of-concept research project. No versions are supported for production use.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| All     | ❌ Research only   |

## Known Security Considerations

This system has several known limitations and potential attack vectors:

### **Platform Dependencies**
- Reliance on social media platform availability and API changes
- Subject to platform terms of service and policy changes
- Data collection dependent on Bright Data service availability

### **Attack Vectors**
- **Sybil Attacks**: Mitigated through platform identity verification and geographic clustering
- **Collusion Attacks**: Economic penalties make coordination costly but not impossible
- **Platform Manipulation**: Cross-platform verification provides some redundancy
- **Data Poisoning**: Community consensus helps but sophisticated attacks possible

### **Privacy Concerns**
- Uses public social media posts only
- Pseudonymization applied but not cryptographically guaranteed
- Geographic data collected at city level

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please email security concerns to: **shannon@loyal9.app**

Include:
- Description of the potential vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 7 days
- **Initial assessment**: Within 14 days  
- **Resolution timeline**: Varies based on severity and complexity

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security issues. We will:
- Acknowledge your contribution
- Work with you on timeline for public disclosure
- Credit you appropriately (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Important Notes

- This is a **research prototype** - not audited for production use
- **No financial transactions** should rely on this system
- **Platform ToS compliance** is user's responsibility
- **Data usage** must comply with Bright Data terms and platform policies
